From the second you boot up the game, it provides you with everything you need to complete it, you just lack one single thing: The knowledge on how to put the pieces together. How you get that knowledge is completely up to the player. The game does not force a mission on you – the minute you get your three-fingered hands on the launch codes for your ship you’re free to go wherever. The game lets you explore at your own pace, and I think that’s what makes it so beautiful. The game becomes more existential the longer you play it and its ending hits you like a brick. I still remember the night where I got to it as clearly as if it happened just a few hours ago. It tore the way in which I saw life up to this point into pieces and reformed it like some sort of big bang. It made me feel incredibly tiny compared to the bigger picture that is the universe and yet managed to make me feel just as important.
